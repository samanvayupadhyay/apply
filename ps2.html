      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>This was initially a hackathon project and one of my favorite designs. I haven't talked about it much here because it primarily just deals with me creating an embedded system by implementing various different design choices that I saw on the internet and it is primarily just a passion project. I initially started working on it in a hackathon with limited hardware. I primarily just worked on making PS2 controller communication be readable by the GPIO. Once I had that, I reverse engineered the communication peripheral, used an open source library called pad32 which makes it so that my embedded system can communicate with any video game controller and programmed the pad32 communication to be translated into PS2 communication. Once that was done, I used the GPIO of my embedded system to work as the controller plug pins of PS2 and just attach it to the PS2 itself and there you have it. In the video, I am using an Xbox controller on a PS2!</p>
